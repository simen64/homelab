# Simen's homelab

This is the repo containing code and configs for my homelab with a focus on IaC and GitOps.

## Hardware
I currently use an old gaming PC for proxmox, an old HP workstation for OPNsense, a raspberry pi for Home Assistant, and a VPS from hetzner for headscale. I am also setting up two workstations to use as a k8s cluster.  
(Pictures and specs coming)

## Software

Table coming soon

Nextcloud runs in a vm on my proxmox node, home assistant on a pi, and headscale on my Hetzner VPS.
